            Hi, my name is Adan Souza Meneguello, I'm 26 years old and I'm from São Paulo, Brazil. My hobbies is workout at gym, watch Motorsport races and also play Simraces.
            I enjoy studying Information Technology in general and I work with it in my current job. 
            Moving to the Development area is my last step towards becoming a complete IT professional as I have training in Embedded Systems in which I applied knowledge of Infrastructure, 
            support and embedded development. My goal with this course is to develop my web skills so that I can create any application, 
            put it on the internet and manage it with the best possible methods.

        <p>São Paulo is the most populous and economically powerful state in Brazil. For Brazilians, it plays a role similar to what states like New York or California represent in the United States—a center of business, 
        finance, innovation, and culture. Its capital city, also named São Paulo, is the largest city in Brazil and one of the biggest in the world. 
        The state is known for its diverse population, strong industries, advanced infrastructure, and important agricultural production. 
        It's a place where people from all over Brazil and the world come to work, study, and seek opportunity.</p>
